This project represents multi-site role based ads site built with .net5.0 from scratch. 

<b>Installation Steps</b>

Clone and run, that's it :) 
<br/>
<br/>
The default access URL is http://localhost:5050/ with autogenerated admin username: <b>admin@email.com</b>, password: <b>Admin123!</b>
<br/>
<br/>
By default the project relies on docker-compose deployment, hence you should have a containerized applications support (<a href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop">Docker Desktop</a>), but you can also alter you settings and host this project in mac, windows or linux.
<br/>
<br/>
<b>Behind the scenes :</b>
There are two docker images, one for the site and one database image. On project startup there is a seed procedure to create a new database (also into mssql container image) if it doesnt exist, a separate site for the multi-site support, localizations, language, roles and an admin account. For more customization see the optional ways for installation via the setup wizard.
